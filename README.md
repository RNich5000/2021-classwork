Coursework outcomes from my Cert IV Programming studies


---WeatherForecastApp
Uses HTML, CSS and JS/JQuery to display a 5-day weather forecast, using an API from openweathermap.org
Forecasts are available parsing XML and JSON data

---GermanFoodQuiz
Uses HTML, CSS and JS/JQuery to display a 5-question quiz, testing the user's knowledge of German food names.
Users can enter their name and see their score compared to other users (this data is saved to local storage)

---HotelBookingsJava
A small Java program, created using NetBeans IDE 11.2.
Stores booking information based on user choice - whether the booking is for a normal room or a suite,
and what room number the user selected. Price is determined accordingly, and bookings can be displayed based on
room type.

---BookStoreJava
A small Java program, created using NetBeans IDE 11.2.
Stores information about books (ISBN, Author, Title, Price) and saves the information in a Book object.
Book data can be recalled or searched for. When the BookStore is full (max 10 books), error messages are displayed.

I placed a strong focus in this program on developing my understanding of regular expressions to perform validation.

---MavisCarRentalC# (parts 1 and 2)
Two Windows Forms programs developed using Visual Studio 2017.
Both files contain the same program, but part 2 has been separated into a User Interface Layer, Business Logic Layer,
and Data Access Layer.
Contains a basic GUi for user navigation (as part of this assignment, only the Branch page was further developed).
Users can perform basic CRUD functions on parts of the database using the GUI.

PLEASE NOTE:
To access the database connection properly, the SqlConnection needs to have the absolute filepath of the database.
In part one, the file path can be found in BranchesForm.cs, line 17
In part two, the file path can be found in DBFunctions.cs, line 25
